# Model Identification and estimation

# ARIMA models are sophisticated models that use correlations between observations at various times.
# ARIMA models show good results when the series is relatively long.
# We use the auto.arima function provided by the forecast package to identify the optimal model and estimate the coefficients
# in a single step.
# stationary = TRUE, restrict search to stationary models.
# seasonal = FALSE restricts the search to non-seasonal models.
# Akaike information criteria as the relative quality measure to be used in the template selection.
modM <- auto.arima(precosM, stationary = TRUE, seasonal = TRUE, ic = "aic")


# Viewing the template
modM

# If the model contains coefficients that are insignificant, we can estimate the new model using the arima function
# with the fixed argument.
confint(modM)

# To evaluate how well the model represents the sample data, we can plot the gross monthly returns
# (the fine black solid line) versus the adjusted values (dashed red dashed line).

plot(modM$x, lty = 1, main = "Sales: Gross data vs. Fitted Values", ylab = "Return %", xlab = "Date")
lines(fitted(modM), lty = 2,lwd = 2, col = "red")

# Calculating other measures of accuracy
accuracy(modM)

# Predicting monthly return 3 months ahead
# To trace the forecast with standard errors, we can use the following command:
predict(modM, n.ahead = 3)

# Plot
plot(forecast(modM))
